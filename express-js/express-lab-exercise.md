### Frameworks
- Node.js
- Express.js

### Topics
1. How to create a web app with Express.js
2. The MVC framework

### Overview
In this lab exercise, you will use a Node.js server and the Express.js web framework to build a web application. 

### Context
- We know how to run a server using Node.js
- We have static HTML, CSS & JavaScript files we need to render in a Browser
- Express.js allows us to serve these static files to the Browser using Node.js

### Basic Requirements
1. Apprentices will obtain a code review where specified in the instructions.

## Setup Instructions
Use the Terminal for navigating around the file system and creating new folders and files. Refer to the lesson on [Shell Commands](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LuOLcpSAtNQlbULx9nWgXJNhgWQlfQ4nzLWQ0DuuPQk/edit?usp=sharing) if you need guidance on using the Terminal.

When you get to the steps below that ask you to initialize a git repo and track files using git, refer to the lesson on [Git and Version Control](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1znMOomkIkAkFKIz2e6t5tLpyzObKqOwfd90fsixSiec/edit?usp=sharing) if you need guidance.

Navigate to the `techtonica-labs` folder located in your Desktop. 
Create a new folder called `getting-started-with-node` within the `techtonica-labs` folder. 
Navigate to `getting-started-with-node`. 
Initialize `getting-started-with-node` as a git repository. 

If you have questions, do not disturb other pairs until you have spent 15-20 minutes troubleshooting within your own pair. Post a message on the #help channel in Slack if you and your pair partner are still stuck after 15-20 minutes. Be sure to format your question using the template we practiced in the [Asking Good Questions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O45nkq2bZX4ZDenmmA1lJ3iTvI80RXiPuOX2w__6Ykw/edit?usp=sharing) lesson.
