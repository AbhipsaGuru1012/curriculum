# Volunteer Assignment Reviewers Guide

Hello and thank you for volunteering your time to help review assignments. This is a huge help to the program because it frees up the onsite Apprentice Manager's time to pair and work with the apprentices directly.

Questions about this doc or process, please reach out to the current [Apprentice Manager (SEAM)](https://techtonica.org/team/) in Slack.
