# Utils Project

Every project of any size grows a utils module that contains random helpers. Many of these outgrow their origins and become a shared general-purpose library, such as [Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15) in JS or ActiveSupport in Ruby.

## Objective

Create your own mini utils file and implement the following functions from lodash:

### Array
- [intersection](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#intersection)
- [difference](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#difference)
- [uniq](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#uniq)

### Map
- [mapValues](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#mapValues): their impl uses plain objects. I suggest you use the JS Map

### String
- [template](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#template) - similar to the built-in backtick strings of ES6

In addition, choose **three more functions** from the (long) list in the [lodash docs](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15).
